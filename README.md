# Kantan

Kantan is a simple and lightweight Rust web server designed for learning purposes. Please note that this project is not intended for production use, and it lacks the security features necessary for a robust and secure server. The primary goal of Kantan is to provide a straightforward example of building a web server in Rust, showcasing concepts such as handling HTTP requests, middleware, and routing.

## Features:

- Minimalistic web server implementation in Rust.
- Demonstrates the basics of handling HTTP requests and responses.
- Includes a simple router for defining routes and handling requests.
- Provides support for middleware to process requests before reaching the router.
- Designed as a learning project, not suitable for production use.
- Feel free to explore, experiment, and learn from this project. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
